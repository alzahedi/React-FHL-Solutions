# React Context API Exercise: Counter with UserContext

## Objective
In this exercise, you'll practice using the Context API in React to manage and share a counter state across components, allowing the user to increase and decrease the counter value.

## Task
You will need to implement a simple component that uses the Context API to manage a counter and provides two buttons: one to increase the counter by one and another to decrease it by one.

Happy coding!
